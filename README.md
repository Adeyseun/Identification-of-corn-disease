# Accurate Identification of Corn Leaf Diseases using a Novel Convolutional Neural Network Approach
This file is an algorithm and dataset for identification of corn disease 
The corn disease pytorch code contained the pytorch code that was used for the work, it should be copied to the development environment
traincorn1, traincorn2, traincorn3 and traincorn4 should be combined to make up the train dataset and name the folder traincorn
The corntest is the test dataset
